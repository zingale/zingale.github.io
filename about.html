		  <h2>About Me</h2>
		</header>

	      <p>I am an Associate Professor in
		the <a href="http://physics.sunysb.edu">Department of
		Physics and Astronomy</a> at
		the <A HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu">State
		University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook</A>, working
		in the <a href="http://astro.sunysb.edu">Astronomy
		Group</a>.</p>

	      <p>Before coming to Stony Brook, I was a postgraduate
		researcher in the Astronomy and Astrophysics
		department at <A HREF="http://www.ucsc.edu">UC Santa
		Cruz</A>, working with
		the <a href="http://supersci.org">Supernovae Science
		Center</a>.  I was formerly a research associate (and
		graduate student before that) at
		the <A HREF="http://flash.uchicago.edu">Center on
		Astrophysical Thermonuclear Flashes</A> at
		the <A HREF="http://www.uchicago.edu"> University of
		Chicago</A>, where I was a co-developer of
		the <a href="http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/">FLASH
		Code</a>.  I did my undergraduate at
		the <a href="http://www.rochester.edu">University of
		Rochester</a>.</p>

	      <span class="about_pic">
		<img src="./about_images/PA080027.JPG" alt="me">
	      </span>

	      <p>My main research interests involve <em>computational
		  astrophysics</em> (particularly the development of
		  new hydrodynamics methods for low Mach number
		  astrophysical flows) and <em>nuclear
		  astrophysics</em> (in particular, studying anything
		  that blows up).  This work is done in collaboration
		  with the <a href="http://ccse.lbl.gov/">Center for
		  Computational Sciences and Engineering at
		  LBL</a>.</p>

	      <p>My main simulation tools are the low Mach number
		hydrodynamics
		code <a href="https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/MAESTROeX">MAESTROeX</a>,
		and its compressible
		counterpart <a href="https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Castro">Castro</a>.
		MAESTROeX solves a low Mach number system of
		hydrodynamics equations that filters soundwaves,
		enabling it to efficiently model convection and
		reactions in stratified flows.  MAESTROeX is more
		general than the traditional anelastic method, as it
		can evolve finite-amplitude density and temperature
		perturbations to a hydrostatic background and can also
		evolve this background state in response to the local
		heating.  Castro models the fully compressible Euler
		equations with self-gravity, reactions, and multigrid
		flux-limited diffusion for radiation.  Both of these
		codes use
		the <a href="http://github.com/AMReX-Codes/">AMReX</a>
		library to manage the adaptive mesh grid hierarchy and
		parallelization.</p>
	      
	      <p>I apply these codes to studying problems in nuclear
		astrophysics, such as various models for Type Ia
		supernovae and X-ray bursts.

	      <p>Examples of SNe Ia applications
		at small scales in white dwarfs include studies of
		the <a href="./simulations/ld/">Landau-Darrieus
		instability</a>, <a href="./simulations/SNrt/">reactive
		Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities</a>,
		and <a href="./simulations/bubbles/">buoyant reacting
		bubbles</a>.  On the full star scale, we've modeled
		the <a href="./simulations/wdconvect/">convection preceding the
		explosion of a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf</a> and
		have now turned our attention
		to <a href="./simulations/subchandra/">convection in sub-Chandra
		models</a>. This work is ongoing.</p>

	      <p>Earlier work in XRBs involved using fully
		compressible hydrodynamics methods to study spreading
		of perturbations and somewhat
		related <a href="./simulations/xray_gallery/">helium
		detonations</a>.  Using Maestro (the predecessor to
		MAESTRROeX), we modeled the convection
		in <a href="./simulations/xrb/">mixed H/He X-ray
		bursts</a> and now are using Castro to model the
		lateral flame spreading.</p>

	      <p>We are also using Castro to
	      model <a href="../simulations/wdmerger/">merging white
	      dwarfs</a>.</p>

	      <p>I have a number of <a href="codes.html">code examples
		online</a> (also on
		my <a href="https://github.com/zingale/">github
		page</a>), including a hydrodynamics teaching code,
		<a href="https://python-hydro.github.io/pyro2/">pyro</a>.  To 
		go along with pyro, I have written a set of notes on
		<a href="https://github.com/Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf/numerical_exercises"><em>Computational
		Hydrodynamics for Astrophysics</em></a>.  To make
		these notes freely available, and encourage
		contributions from the community, I started a project
		called
		the <a href="https://open-astrophysics-bookshelf.github.io/">Open
		Astrophysics Bookshelf</a>.</p>

	      <P>Further back, I was one of the original developers of
		the <A HREF="http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode">FLASH
		Code</A>.  This code has seen wide adoption for
		astrophysical problems involving compressible flows.</p>

	      <p>My XRB/supernovae and low Mach number hydrodynamics
		research is supported primarily by a grant from the
		the Dept. of Energy, Office of Nuclear Physics.  The
		white dwarf merger studies were supported by the NSF
		and now DOE.</p>
