		<h2>About Me</h2>
	      </header>

	      <p>I am an Associate Professor in
		the <a href="http://physics.sunysb.edu">Department of
		Physics and Astronomy</a> at
		the <A HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu">State University
		of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook</A>, working in
		the <a href="http://astro.sunysb.edu">Astronomy
		Group</a>.</p>

	      <p>Before coming to Stony Brook, I was a postgraduate
		researcher in the Astronomy and Astrophysics
		department at <A HREF="http://www.ucsc.edu">UC Santa
		Cruz</A>, working with
		the <a href="http://supersci.org">Supernovae Science
		Center</a>.  I was formerly a research associate (and
		graduate student before that) at
		the <A HREF="http://flash.uchicago.edu">Center on
		Astrophysical Thermonuclear Flashes</A> at
		the <A HREF="http://www.uchicago.edu"> University of
		Chicago</A>, where I was a co-developer of
		the <a href="http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/">FLASH
		Code</a>.  I did my undergraduate at
		the <a href="http://www.rochester.edu">University of
		Rochester</a>.</p>

	      <span class="about_pic">
		<img src="./about_images/PA080027.JPG" alt="me">
	      </span>

	      <p>My main research interests involve <em>computational
		  astrophysics</em> (particularly the development of
		  new hydrodynamics methods for low Mach number
		  astrophysical flows) and <em>nuclear
		  astrophysics</em> (in particular, studying anything
		  that blows up).  This work is done in collaboration
		  with the <a href="http://ccse.lbl.gov/">Center for
		  Computational Sciences and Engineering at
		  LBL</a>.</p>

	      <p>My main simulation tools are low Mach number
		hydrodynamics Maestro, and its compressible
		counterpart,
		Castro.  <a href="https://boxlib-codes.github.io/MAESTRO/">Maestro</a>
		solves a low Mach number system of hydrodynamics
		equations that filters soundwaves, enabling it to
		efficiently model convection and reactions in
		stratified flows.  Maestro is more general than the
		traditional anelastic method, as it can evolve
		finite-amplitude density and temperature perturbations
		to a hydrostatic background and can also evolve this
		background state in response to the local heating. Its
		sister code, <a href=
		"https://ccse.lbl.gov/Research/CASTRO/">Castro</a>
		models the fully compressible Euler equations with
		self-gravity, reactions, and multigrid flux-limited
		diffusion for radiation.  Both of these codes use
		the <a href="https://ccse.lbl.gov/BoxLib/index.html">BoxLib</a>
		library to manage the adaptive mesh grid hierarchy and
		parallelization.</p>
	      
	      <p>I apply these codes to studying problems in nuclear
		astrophysics, such as various models for Type Ia
		supernovae and X-ray bursts.

	      <p>Examples of SNe Ia applications
		at small scales in white dwarfs include studies of
		the <a href="./simulations/ld/">Landau-Darrieus
		instability</a>, <a href="./simulations/SNrt/">reactive
		Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities</a>,
		and <a href="./simulations/bubbles/">buoyant reacting
		bubbles</a>.  On the full star scale, we've modeled
		the <a href="./simulations/wdconvect/">convection preceding the
		explosion of a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf</a> and
		have now turned our attention
		to <a href="./simulations/subchandra/">convection in sub-Chandra
		models</a>. This work is ongoing.</p>

	      <p>Earlier work in XRBs involved using fully
		compressible hydrodynamics methods to study
		spreading of perturbations
		and somewhat related <a href="./simulations/xray_gallery/">helium
		detonations</a>.  Currently, I am working with Chris
		Malone to model convection
		in <a href="./simulations/xrb/">mixed H/He X-ray bursts</a>.</p>

	      <p>I'm also using Castro to model merging white dwarfs
		(this is together with Alan Calder and Doug
		Swesty).</p>

	      <p>I have a number of <a href="codes.html">code examples
		online</a> (also on
		my <a href="https://github.com/zingale/">github
		page</a>), including a hydrodynamics teaching code,
		<a href="https://zingale.github.io/pyro2/">pyro</a>.  To 
		go along with pyro, I have written a set of notes on
		<a href="https://github.com/Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf/numerical_exercises"><em>Computational
		Hydrodynamics for Astrophysics</em></a>.  To make
		these notes freely available, and encourage
		contributions from the community, I started a project
		called
		the <a href="https://open-astrophysics-bookshelf.github.io/">Open
		Astrophysics Bookshelf</a>.</p>

	      <P>Further back, I was one of the original developers of
		the <A HREF="http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode">FLASH
		Code</A>.  This code has seen wide adoption for
		astrophysical problems involving compressible flows.</p>

	      <p>My XRB/supernovae and low Mach number hydrodynamics
		research is supported primarily by a grant from the
		the Dept. of Energy, Office of Nuclear Physics.  The
		white dwarf merger studies are supported by the NSF.</p>
