<p align="center"><font size="+2">I/O from Parallel Hydro Codes (using HDF5)</font>

<p>This page attempts to discuss how to take data from a parallel
hydrodynamics code and store it in a single file on disk.  We choose
to use the <a href="hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu">HDF5</a> format for this
tutorial.

<p>Two methods are presented here: serial and parallel I/O.  The
ultimate goal is to have a single file containing our data from all
the processors.  The parallel I/O method is preferred (and much
simpler to code), but requires that the machine have a parallel file
system (i.e. GPFS, <a
href="http://parlweb.parl.clemson.edu/pvfs/">PVFS</a>) for best
performance.  NFS mounted disks probably may not perform too well (see
the <a
href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/buglist-tbl.html">MPICH
bugs page</a>).

<p><font size="+1" color="red">Advantages of HDF5 over native binary</font>

<p>The HDF5 library provides a set of high level library functions for
describing and storing simple and complex data structures.  The
library automatically stores datatype information and metadata
describing the rank, dimensions, and other data properties.
Conversion functions between datatypes are also provided, and the data
is stored portably, so no byte swapping is necessary when reading the
data in on a platform with a different endianness.

<p>Data is stored in datasets, which can be queried to find out the
size, layout, etc.  Data can be read by specifying the name of the
dataset (like 'density'), instead of having to know the details of how
the file is laid out.  This allows anyone to be able to query and read
in the data without having to know the details of how it was written out.

<p>Finally, HDF5 allows for parallel I/O (through MPI-IO), while
maintaining the flexibility of the file format.  Data written out in
parallel can be read in serially on another platform without any
conversion.

<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size="+1" color="red">Description of our data structures</font>

<p>It is assumed that the hydro code carries around a (set of) data
structure(s) that are basically an array with a perimeter of
guardcells.  This arrangement is very common in hydrodynamics -- the
guardcells serve to hold the data from off processor, or to implement
the boundary conditions.

<p>Each processor contains a data array with <em>NX</em> zones in the
x-direction, and <em>NY</em> zones in the y-direction., and <em>NG</em>
guardcells.

<p align="center"><img src="data_array.png" width="330" height="330">

<p>A further simpliciation is that the domain decomposition is in
one-dimension only (we choose x).  The total number of zones comprising the
computational domain is NPES*NX x NY.  This is illustrated below:

<p align="center"><img src="dataspace.png" width="703" height="217">

<p>The dashed line indicates that actual extend of the 2nd processor's
sub-domain -- showing the perimeter of guardcells.  

<p>We want to write the data out into a single file, and organize it like
it as pictured above.  The benefit to this arrangemnent (as compared to storing
each proc's data in a separate array), is that it is then relatively easy to
restart on a different number of processors.  The computational domain can
be cut into a different number of pieces upon restart, and those chucks can 
just be read from the since record in the file.

<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size="+1" color="red">Using hyperslabs to select the interior zones</font>

<p>The first example serves to familiarize the user with the HDF5 library
and how to select only a portion of an array for storage -- in our case,
the interior zones.

<p>HDF5 uses the concept of dataspaces and memory spaces to deal with the 
passing data from memory to file.  The memory space describes the layout 
of the data to be written as it exists in memory.  The memory space does
not need to be contiguous.

<p>The dataspace describes the layout of the data as it will be stored in the
file.  As with the memory space, there is no constraint that the elements 
in the dataspace be contiguous.  

<p>When data is written (via the H5Dwrite call), the data is transferred 
from memory to disk.  It is required that the number of elements in the 
memory space be the same as that in the dataspace -- the layouts do not need 
to match however.  If the data is non-contiguous, a gather/scatter is 
performed during the write operation.

<p>The first example defines a dataspace in the HDF5 file large enough to
hold the interior elements of one of our patches.  A memory space is
created describing the array, and the interior cells are picked out 
using a hyperslab select call.

<p>The source code implementing this procedure is here: <a
href="HDF5_simple/hdf5_simple.c">hdf5_simple.c</a>




<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size="+1" color="red">Writing out the data serially</font>

<p>One way to get the data from multiple processors into a single file
on disk is to explicitly send it all to one processor, and have only
that master processor open the file, do the writing, and close the
file.  The code this more complicated than the parallel I/O version we
look at below, but on some systems (i.e. those lacking a parallel
filesystem), it may be the only option.

<p>We assume that each processors has one or more data arrays declared
as<br> 

&nbsp;<br> 
<tt>double data[2*NG+NY][2*NG+NX]</tt>.<br>
&nbsp;<br> 

Alternately, there could be a single data array with an
extra dimension to hold the different variables carried by the hydro
code<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<tt>double data[2*NG+NY][2*NG+NV][NVAR]</tt>.<br> 
&nbsp;<br>

In the example below, we assume a single variable.  Adding multiple
variables simply requires an extra loop over the number of variables
wrapping the code shown below.

<p>In addition to the data array(s), we need a single buffer array
that will just hold the interior zones (i.e. excluding the guardcells)
from the data array for the current variable.  This array is just of
size NX x NY<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<tt>double buffer[NY][NX]</tt>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

Furthermore, it is important that the elements in these arrays be contiguous
in memory.  In Fortran, declaring a multidimensional array as:<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<tt>real (kind = dp), dimension (NX, NY) :: buffer<br></tt>
&nbsp;<br>

guarantees that the elements are contiguous.  In C, it is necessary to 
allocate a 1-d array of size NX*NY to guarantee that the elements are
contiguous (see the examples).

<p>The basic algorithm for writing the data is to designate one processor
as the master processor -- this is the processor that will open the
file, do the writing, and then close the file.  All other processors
will need to send their data to the buffer array on the master processor
in order for it to be written out.  We assume that the master processor
is processor 0.

<p>To start, each processor (including the master processor) copies the 
interior cells from the data array into the buffer array on they've 
allocated.  Then, a loop over all processors is performed, and the
data is written out in processor order.  The first processor to write
out its data is processor 0 (our master processor).  It already contains the
data it needs in its buffer array, so it simple writes its data to
the file.  

<p>When writing to the HDF file, we need to create a dataspace in the
file.  This describes how the data will be stored in the file.  We
tell the library that our dataspace is NPES*NX x NY cells.  Each
processor only writes to a subset of that dataspace, and we need to
tell the HDF5 library which subset to write to before the actual
write.  This is accomplished via the hyperslab function in the HDF5
library.  We give it a starting point, a size, and a stride, and it
knows which portion of the dataspace to write to.

<p>After processor 0's data is written, we move to the next processor.
Now we need to move the data from the buffer on processor 1 to the
buffer on processor 0.  This is accomplished by an MPI_Send/Recv pair.
Once the data is sent, processor 0 can write it's buffer (no holding
processor 1's data) to the file.  This process is outlined in the
figure below.

<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size="+1" color="red">Writing out the data in parallel</font>

<p>A better way to get the data from multiple processors into a single file
on disk is to rely on the underlying MPI-IO layer of HDF5 to perform the
necessary communication.  MPI-IO implementations on different systems are 
usually optimized for their platform and can perform quite well.

<p>As above, we assume that each processors has one or more data arrays
declared as<br>

&nbsp;<br> 
<tt>double data[2*NG+NY][2*NG+NX]</tt>.<br>
&nbsp;<br> 

<p>In contrast to the serial example, we do not require a buffer array,
rather, we rely of the HDF5 hyperslab functionality to pick out only
the interior of our array when writing to disk.  Each processor opens
the file (in parallel), creates the dataspaces and memoryspaces, and writes
the data directly to the file.  There is no explicit communication here.

<p align="center"><img src="parallel_io.png" width="789" height="375">

<p>The source code implementing this procedure is here: <a
href="HDF5_parallel/hdf5_parallel.c">hdf5_parallel.c</a>

<p>In addition to performing the I/O, an MPI_Info object is created
and passed to the MPI-IO implementation through the HDF5 library.
This object contains hints, described in the <a
href="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-20-html/node172.htm#Node172">MPI-2
I/O chapter</a>.  These <a
href="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-20-html/node182.htm#Node183">hints</a>
should be experimented with in order to find the best performance.

<p>&nbsp;
<p><font size="+1" color="red">IDL Interface</font>

<p>At present, there is no native support for HDF5 in <a
href="http://www.rsinc.com/idl/index.asp">IDL</a>.  To read in a HDF5
file, it is necessary to wrap the HDF5 library calls in a library that
IDL can handle.  One way to do this is to create a shared-object
library containing the read routines and use <tt>call_external</tt> to
interface with it.  <tt>call_external</tt> passes void pointers to the IDL data
through argc/v.  These need to be recast as pointers to the proper
datatype inside the wrapper and then can be used with the HDF5 calls.

<p>An example of such wrappers are provided here: <a href="IDL_HDF5/idl_hdf5.tar">
idl_hdf5.tar</a>.  Included are the C wrappers, a header file, and a 
Makefile for a Linux box.  Other platforms should be able to handle this
without much modification.  Refer to the call_external documentation for
the proper compilation/link flags for your platform.
