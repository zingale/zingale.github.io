<p><div class="abstract">In the single-degenerate model for a Type Ia
   supernovae, a white dwarf accretes from its binary companion until
   it approaches the Chandrasekhar mass.  The extreme temperature and
   density at the center allow carbon fusion to take place, which in
   turn drives convection throughout the interior of the white dwarf.
   This convective 'simmering' phase can last centuries, while the
   interior of the white dwarf continues to heat up.  Eventually, the
   temperature rises to the point that reactions proceed faster than
   the fluid can cool via expansion (as it is carried away from the
   center by the convective flow).  At this point a burning front (a
   flame) is born (ignition), which propagates through the white dwarf
   in seconds (possibly transitioning to a detonation), buring the
   carbon and oxygen into nickel, iron, and intermediate mass nuclei.
   Exactly where and how many initial flames arise at the end of the
   simmering phase is not known.  We model the final hours of this
   convective period to better understand this ignition process.

<P><H2>I. Simulation Details</H2>

<p>The convective flow preceeding the ignition of a Type Ia supernova
is highly subsonic.  Traditional, fully compressible hydrodynamics
methods use explicit timestepping, and have a timestep that is limited
by the sound-crossing time across a single computational cell.  For
low Mach numbers, this is prohibitively small.  Our approach to
modeling this problem is to use the low Mach number hydrodynamics
code, <a href="http://amrex-astro.github.io/MAESTRO/">Maestro</a>.  In the low Mach number
hydrodynamics approach, the compressible hydrodynamics equations are
reformulated to analytically filter soundwaves from the system.  
The fluid state is decomposed into a 1-d radial base state (with the
density, &rho;<sub>0</sub>, in hydrostatic equilibrium with the
base state pressure, p<sub>0</sub>) and a 3-d full state.  
The
velocity field is constrained by an elliptic
constraint,</p>
<div class="eq">
&nabla; &sdot; ( &beta;<sub>0</sub>U) =
&beta;<sub>0</sub>[ S - 1 /(&Gamma;<sub>1</sub>p<sub>0</sub>)
&part;p<sub>0</sub>/&part;t]
</div>
<p>which captures the compressbility effects due to reactions (through
S), and the background stratification of the star (through the
density-like quantity, &beta;<sub>0</sub>).  The result is an
algorithm that allows for timesteps determined by the fluid velocity,
instead of the sound speed.  For very low Mach number flows, this
timestep is ~1/M larger than those allowed by an explicit
fully-compressible code.  Maestro is freely available for use.

<p>All calculations start by placing the white dwarf in our 3-D
Cartesian domain with 384<sup>3</sup> zones (5x10<sup>8</sup> cm on a
side).  The entire star is modeled.  Figure 1 shows our initial model,
generated by the 1-d stellar evolution code, Kepler.  Our original
simulation begin at the
point when the central temperature has risen to
6x10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;K.  Later simulations use an initial model with a
central temperature of 6.25x10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;K.

<p><h3>IIa. Initial Results (Zingale et al. 2009)</h3>

<p>WD paper I explored the final hours of the convection and showed the
non-linear rise in the temperature as we approach ignition and explored
the details of the convective velocity field and ignition location.

<p>Immediately at the start of the 3-d calculation, thermonuclear
carbon reactions heat the interior of the star, driving convection
throughout the convectively unstable region.  After a short tranisent,
a convective flow develops throughout the inner ~solar mass of the white
dwarf.  As the reactions proceed, the central temperature of the 
star increases, increasing the reactions, and further  heating up the
interior of the star.  Hot plumes cool as they rise and expand,
preventing ignition until the central temperature crosses
~8x10<sup>8</sup> K, and the reactions outpace the cooling via
expansion.  The convective flow has a dipole pattern, which rapidly
changes direction.  Overall, we model the last ~2 hours of the
convection.  Our calculation ends when the first flame ignites.



<p>Figure 2 shows the peak temperature in the white dwarf as a function of
time.  The temperature increases steadily for about 2 hours, before the
final ignition&mdash;the point where the temperature rapidly increases to
over 10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;K.  The inset shows the temperature
during the last ~250&nbsp;s, where large fluctuations are
evident, produced by hotspots that failed to ignite.

<p>Figure 3 shows the magnitude of the vorticity in a single slice

distinct separation between the convectively unstable interior and the
surrounding convectively stable material.  The late-time breakdown of
this distinction seen in the last frame is under investigation and may
be an artifact of not evolving the background state.

s preceding ignition for the 576<sup>3</sup> simulation.</div>



<p><h3>IIb. Studies of Ignition Radius (Zingale et al. 2011)</h3>

<p>For WD paper II, we ran several simulations with an improved
algorithm (higher-order advection, increased coupling between the full
state and base state, and a time-dependent base state), better
energetics, and rotation.  The main result of this paper was a
histogram showing the likely ignition radius by considering the final
200&nbsp;s of evolution&mdash;this strongly suggested that off-center
ignition is favored.

<p>The main calculation presented in WD paper II is a non-rotating
model on a 576<sup>3</sup> grid (corresponding to 8.8&nbsp;km
resolution).  Two more runs at 384<sup>3</sup> were also featured&mdash;
one non-rotating and one rotating at 1.5% of the Keplerian rate.

<p>We constructed histograms (see Figure 4) of the likely ignition
radius by time-averaging the radial location of the hottest point in
the convective zone over 1&nbsp;s intervals.  This resulting
distribution shows that the hotspots are most likely to be found
~50&nbsp;km off-center&mdash;indicating that off-center ignition is
likely.  Furthermore, if we look at the radial velocity of the hotspot,
it is most likely to be moving radially outward, away from the center
of the star.  This is indicated by the coloring in Figure 4.

<p>Another finding was that the time to ignition was shorter for the
rotating runs.  Contours of energy generation and radial velocity for
the 576<sup>3</sup> and two 384<sup>3</sup> runs are shown in Figure 5.
These show that the energy generation is stongly peaked toward the center
of the star.  We also see that the rotating case lacks some of the coherency
in the flow that we see in the non-rotating models.

<p><h3>IIc. Characterizing Turbulence (Nonaka et al. 2012)</h3>

<p>Our final paper focused on the turbulence in the convection region.
Using AMR, we restarted our 576<sup>3</sup> calculation with 1- and 2-
additional levels of refinement (making effective zoning of
1152<sup>3</sup> and 2304<sup>3</sup>).  At high resolution, we found
that the results presented in Zingale et al. 2011 held.  We extending
our histograms to look at whether a hotspot was heating or cooling and
found that the likely ignition location is a bit closer to the center
of the star (still off-center).  At this higher resolution, the
convective outflow was better described as a jet:

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2PA5Uc77_o?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Additionally, we focused on the dynamics of the hotspots at the point
of ignition and showed that it is likely that only a single hotspot
will ignite&mdash;no other hotspots that can runaway exist at the time
of ignition.

<p>A close up of the center of a white dwarf at the point of ignition
of a Type Ia supernova. Here we see temperature contours. The blue dot
represents the geometric center of the star, and its size is the size
of a zone in this simulation (effective resolution 4.4 km).
We see a failed hotspot (moving toward the lower left) -- it gets hot
and then cools as it expands and moves outward from the
center. Following this is the hotspot that ignites (moving toward the
lower right). For this study, we turned off the burning in the hotspot
once it passed a critical level to allow us to see the dynamics of any
other hotspots. A third hotspot, in the upper right corner, never gets
hot enough to runaway -- it goes out on its own.

<p>Finally, we characterized the turbulence and found that the turbulent
intensity is ~10 km/s on an integral scale of ~150 km.  This is considerably
weaker turbulence than assumed in the literature.  The figure below
summarizes the velocities present in the early stages of the Type Ia
supernova explosion.
